## Visualizing Foreign Attacks on EU - Interactive Map

#### Overview
- This project creates an interactive map visualizing various incidents of foreign attacks on European Union (EU) countries. The map is built using _Python_, with data manipulation done via _pandas_, and visualization achieved through _plotly_. The map includes details such as cyberattacks, espionage activities, disinformation campaigns, and other significant incidents.

### Features
* **Interactive Elements**: The map includes interactive markers for each incident. You can hover over these markers to get detailed information about specific incidents.
* **Customized Markers**: Different types of incidents are represented by unique colors and icons for easy identification.
* **Zoom and Pan**: The map allows users to zoom in/out and pan around to explore incidents in different regions.
* **Legend and Annotations**: A legend is provided for understanding marker symbols and colors. Additional annotations offer guidance on map interaction.
* **Responsive Design**: The layout adjusts to different screen sizes, ensuring a seamless experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
